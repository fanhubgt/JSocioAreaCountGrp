LANGUAGE PROCESSING IN NATURAL GROUPS.

This is about language processing of 
natural groups from the perspective of (S)ocial group, (A)rea group,(C)ountry group, thing group, people group and local group in engineering perspective. A human-computer interface(HCI) made with graphical user interface is provided to stimulate the generation of new language from a text. The text is read from file and processed into a vector data structure and keyed positions for each group is sub-listed into a tabbed orientation interface. This tab-oriented interface is randomly selected to create a simulation of interaction automatically. A group analysis is performed on each line of text as provided in a file system.
